            Hi! My name is Michael Shyu. I am currently a junior in college majoring in Computer Science and minoring in architecture.I am attending Miami University in Oxford Ohio. Growing up, I played sports including swimming and golf, but I was never really into technology aside from video games. Coding and computer sciences never really appealed to me, I always thought that the concept was quite interesting, but I never really thought it was for me. Until my sophomore year of college. I was majoring in architecture and chose that major for my interest in buildings and the process behind them. I was enjoying it, but not as much as I should be to follow a career in it. During winter break of sophomore year and some personal issues, I changed my major to computer science and took my first steps into the world of coding.
